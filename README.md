# Feature Manipulation Engine Comma Separated Values to Minecraft Converter

A conversion program used to import 3D coordinate files into Minecraft.

## Project Purpose

Three dimensional coordinate files are used frequently in the American River College Design Hub, be it for 3D modeling software such as Blender, Computer Aided Design software like AutoCAD, or various drone projects. These applications are incredibly useful for designing 3D objects, but require specialized training or licenses to use. To rectify this issue, this program can convert files to a format anyone can use: Minecraft. Minecraft allows for easy, if not precise, manipulation of 3D spaces in a way many are familiar with.

## Getting Started

In order to run the converter program, you will need FME Desktop installed. You can start a free trial of FME Desktop [here](https://www.safe.com/fme/fme-desktop/), but it will require purchasing a license to continue using the application after the free trial expires. Contact a Design Hub supervisor for more details.
