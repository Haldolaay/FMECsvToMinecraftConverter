Project Goal:
    Convert 3-dimensional data of the American River College into Minecraft,
    allowing students to take a virtual tour of the campus,
    and implement the Wayfinding project into the Minecraft world so students can find their way around campus.

Steps to complete:
    [*] Convert CSV [x, y, z] file to Minecraft.
    [] Convert CSV [x, y, z, r, g, b] to Minecraft.
    [] Convert other file formats to CSV [x, y, z, r, g, b] which can then be converted to Minecraft.
      \_(Which formats do we want?)
    [] Add more user-friendly method of converting files to Minecraft.
        - Matt proposes a script which features a GUI asking for a file,
          which then feeds the file into the appropriate (FILE_TYPE)->(CSV) converter,
          and then the (CSV)->(MC) converter.
An asterisk denotes the step is complete
